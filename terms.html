9. Moderation and enforcement
We utilize two methods to moderate objectionable content on pumped. They are:
1. Users post events in real time, and our content moderators monitor events posted
on a regular basis.
2. Users post events in real time, and other users have the ability to report or hide
the content, or if it is a user’s profile, report or block the user. If a user feels, for
any reason, that an event or a user profile contains offensive, spam-like, sexual,
hateful, or any other content that violates pumped’s Terms of Service, that user
may 
1. Report the event or profile to pumped,
2. Block that user on the platform.
If a user is abusive or behaves on pumped in any way that violates pumped’s Terms of
Service, another user may report that user to pumped and/or block that user.
So, by incorporating this approach to moderate content and filter objectionable content,
we aim to provide our users with a high quality experience and minimize inappropriate
behavior. We take our Terms of Service very seriously and enforce our rules through our
moderation policy strictly.
ENFORCEMENT
Once a user reports an event or user profile to pumped, one of our content moderators
will review the reported material within 24 hours, if not sooner due to real time
moderation by our content moderation team. If the reported content is an event, and the

event violates our Terms of Service, the event will immediately be taken down and
notice and warning given to the user who posted the event as well as users who joined
the event. If it is a serious infraction, the user will be immediately removed and banned
from the pumped platform without notice or warning.
If the reported content is a user or user’s profile, and the user’s profile or user’s behavior
is deemed to be in violation of pumped’s Terms of Service, the prohibited content will
immediately be removed by the content moderator and the user in question will be
notified and warned. If it is a serious infraction, the user will be immediately removed
and banned from the pumped platform without notice or warning.
We take our Terms of Service very seriously and make our best attempt to well-inform
our users of our Terms so that they may follow them and maintain a high quality
experience on pumped for all users. We uphold a zero tolerance enforcement policy
where prohibited content is removed immediately, users only receive one warning from
low to moderate infractions, and no warning and immediate removal and banning from
the pumped platform for serious or purposeful infractions.
10. Governing law, severability, dispute
resolution and venue
Governing Law. This Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the
internal laws of the State of Utah without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law
provision or rule. Any legal suit, action, or proceeding arising out of or related to this
Agreement or the Application shall be instituted exclusively in the federal courts of the
United States or the courts of the State of Utah in each case located in Logan and Cache
County.
Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is illegal or unenforceable under
applicable law, the remainder of the provision will be amended to achieve as closely as
possible the effect of the original term and all other provisions of this Agreement will
continue in full force and effect[; provided, however, that if any fundamental term or
provision of this Agreement (including without limitation [APPLICABLE
FUNDAMENTAL TERMS]), is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement shall be unenforceable].
YOU AND pumped LLC AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE
OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF
OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.
11. Changes to Terms of Service
